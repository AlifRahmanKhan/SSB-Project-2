                    Editor’s Note: Travel might be complicated right now, but use our inspirational trip ideas to plan ahead for your next bucket list adventure. Long weekends – whether brought on by national holidays, summer Fridays, or that rogue PTO day you’ve been hoarding
                    – offer the ideal window for a brief reset and change of scenery. Especially now, as people have been quarantining at home and socially distancing while out, you might need a vacation more than ever. In fact, spending a mere 72 hours
                    away can provide a much-needed recharge when you don’t have weeks of vacation to spare. That said, pinning down a place to visit can be tough when you only have a few days. You’ll want a destination that feels like a real holiday,
                    but is also conveniently located so you won’t have to waste much time on the road (or in the air), as well as feels safe, especially now. Dreaming of a beach vacation on an island? Head to Bermuda, just a 90-minute flight from New
                    York City, for scuba diving, snorkeling, cliff-diving, or relaxing on one of the many beautiful stretches of sand. Seeking a bit more adventure? Gas up the car and spend your long weekend hiking in Acadia National Park in Maine. Or,
                    do you prefer a bustling city? Philadelphia might be your ticket. No matter where your next vacation takes you, be sure to check state and country guidelines and protocols before visiting. Here’s where Travel + Leisure editors are
                    hoping to jet off to for a long weekend, from the mountains to beaches and everything in between. As for mustering up the motivation to return to work on Monday – well, that’s on you.
